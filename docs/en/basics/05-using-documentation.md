# Using This Documentation

## Bilingual Structure

### Why Two Languages?
This documentation is available in both English and Arabic to:
- Make Linux knowledge accessible to Arabic speakers
- Support the growing tech community in Arabic-speaking regions
- Provide accurate technical content in both languages
- Bridge the knowledge gap between English and Arabic resources

### Language Navigation
1. **Switching Languages**
   - Use the language selector in the navigation bar
   - Toggle between 'English' and 'العربية'
   - All content is mirrored in both languages

2. **URL Structure**
   - English content: `/en/...`
   - Arabic content: `/ar/...`
   - Same structure and organization in both languages

## Using Commands

### Command Format
Commands in this documentation follow this format:
```bash
# Comment explaining what the command does
command [options] arguments
```

Example:
```bash
# List all files including hidden ones
ls -la
```

### Command Components
1. **Comments**
   - Start with `#`
   - Explain the purpose of the command
   - Provide context when needed

2. **Command Structure**
   - Command name: The actual command to run
   - Options: Modify command behavior (start with `-` or `--`)
   - Arguments: Values or targets for the command

3. **Examples**
   ```bash
   # Basic command
   ls

   # Command with options
   ls -l

   # Command with options and arguments
   ls -l /home
   ```

### Best Practices

1. **Understanding Commands**
   - Read the comment first
   - Understand each part of the command
   - Check man pages for more details: `man command_name`

2. **Testing Commands**
   - Start with simple versions
   - Add options gradually
   - Use `--help` for quick reference

3. **Safety Measures**
   - Always read command descriptions
   - Be cautious with destructive commands (rm, dd, etc.)
   - Use `sudo` only when necessary
